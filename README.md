## Installation
Becuase SubwayCSS is really new, one of two ways to install SubwayCSS onto your website is by injecting this line of code into your HTML file:
```html
<link rel="stylesheet" href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/5qc/SubwayCSS/main/subway.min.css" />
```

And if you want to locally host your own version of SubwayCSS, just download the content from the raw file and import the file location into your HTML project.

## Customization
Customizing SubwayCSS is really easy, as there is only one file that controls all (actually most) of the settings, `_settings.scss`. From that file, you can control the font, font weight, and even the class prefix.

## Reporting Bugs
If you found a bug within SubwayCSS, first search through the [issues](https://github.com/5qc/SubwayCSS/issues) that are currently open or closed within this GitHub project. If the bug you found is not there, you can either report it through the issue tab or create a [pull request](https://github.com/5qc/SubwayCSS/pulls).
