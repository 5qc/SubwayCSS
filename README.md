> ***NOTE**: CDN is currently broken right now. I am currently working on getting CDN working for SubwayCSS. As this is happening, I still want people to enjoy new SubwayCSS, so there will be a temporary `subway.min.css` file here.*

**SubwayCSS** is a sleek, brand-new CSS framework that turns your site into the great American multinational sandwich shop!

## Installation
To put SubwayCSS into your site, just install the following code:
```html
<link rel="stylesheet" href="https://subwaycss.glitch.me/latest/subway.min.css" />
```
Or if you want a specific version of SubwayCSS:
```html
<link rel="stylesheet" href="https://subwaycss.glitch.me/vx.x.x/subway.min.css" />
```

And if you want to locally host your own version of SubwayCSS, just download the content from the raw file and import the file location into your HTML project.

## Customization
Customizing SubwayCSS is really easy, as there is only one file that controls all (actually most) of the settings, `_settings.scss`. From that file, you can control the font, font weight, and even the class prefix.

## Reporting Bugs
If you found a bug within SubwayCSS, first search through the [issues](https://github.com/5qc/SubwayCSS/issues) that are currently open or closed within this GitHub project. If the bug you found is not there, you can either report it through the issue tab or create a [pull request](https://github.com/5qc/SubwayCSS/pulls).
