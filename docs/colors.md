# Colors
SubwayCSS has 7 colors; yellow, green, red, dark green, gray, white, and black. SubwayCSS also has two gradients, yellow to green and green to yellow. These colors are used frequently, and is the barebone of SubwayCSS.

There are many different classes that use these, such as `sw-container`, `sw-navbar`, `sw-modal`, and many more. To activate these, you can do `sw-<color>`. For example, the color yellow will have the class of `sw-yellow`. If you want to make the text yellow, you do `sw-text-yellow`. Gradients also work with text, such as `sw-text-yellow-green` and `sw-text-green-yellow`.
